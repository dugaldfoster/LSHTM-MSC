# LSHTM-MSC

This repository includes coding and analysis scripts used in my 2018 MSc project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medcine.

The title of the project is "Intergenerational Conflict and Child Mortality Outcomes in Four Countries: A Cross-Sectional Study". Building off a game theoretic model (Moya and Sear 2014 - https://peerj.com/articles/512/), I'll be testing some hypotheses from human behavioural ecology and life history theory. In particular, I'm interested in the role of family composition and intergenerational conflict in influencing reproductive timing and child mortality outcomes. The data I'm using come from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for four countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakisatan. 

I'm relatively new to Github so it's a good way to practise my open science skills too!
