# LSHTM-MSC
Work for my MSc project at LSHTM

This repository includes coding and analysis scripts used in my 2018 MSc project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medcine.

The title of the project is "The Evolutionary and Ecological Determinants of Age at First Birth". Building off a game theoretic model (Moya and Sear 2014 - https://peerj.com/articles/512/), I'll be testing some hypotheses from human behavioural ecology and life history theory. In particular, I'm interested in the role of family composition and intergenerational conflict in influencing reproductive timing. The data I'm using are for low income countries, and come from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). 

I'm relatively new to Github so it's a good way to practise my open science skills too!
