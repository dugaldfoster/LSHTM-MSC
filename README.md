# LSHTM-MSC

This repository includes coding and analysis scripts used in my 2018 MSc project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medcine.

The title of the project is "Reproductive Conflict and Child Mortality Outcomes in Four Countries: A Cross-Sectional Study". I'll be testing some hypotheses from behavioural ecology and life history theory. In particular, I'm interested in the role of family composition and reproductive conflict in influencing fitness through child mortality. The data I'm using come from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for four countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakisatan. In total, I analyse nearly 2 million birth outcomes.

I'm relatively new to Github so it's a good way to practise my open science skills too!
