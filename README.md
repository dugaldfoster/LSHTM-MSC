# LSHTM-MSC

This repository includes coding and analysis scripts used in my 2018 MSc project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medcine.

The title of the project is "Reproductive Conflict and Child Mortality Outcomes in Four Countries: A Cross-Sectional Study". I'll be testing some hypotheses from behavioural ecology and life history theory. In particular, I'm interested in the effects of family composition and reproductive conflict on fitness via child mortality. The data I'm using come from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for four countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. In total, I analyse nearly 2 million birth outcomes. This was largely made possible through using the amazing rdhs package (https://ojwatson.github.io/rdhs/articles/introduction.html), which I would highly recommend to anyone working with DHS data in R.

I'm relatively new to Github so it's a good way to practise my open science skills too!
